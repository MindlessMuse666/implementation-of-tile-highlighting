The game level consists of tiles.

Implemented visual highlighting of tiles when hovering the cursor. That is, when the player moves the cursor over a certain tile, its color should change, and when the player moves the cursor outside the tile, its color returns to the original one.

Selection only works for grass or bridge tiles, while water tiles are not highlighted.
